sim-cache: This simulator implements a functional cache simulator.  Cache
statistics are generated for a user-selected cache and TLB configuration,
which may include up to two levels of instruction and data cache (with any
levels unified), and one level of instruction and data TLBs.  No timing
information is generated.

# -pcstat              <null> # profile stat(s) against text addr's (mult uses ok)

  The cache config parameter <config> has the following format:

    <name>:<nsets>:<bsize>:<assoc>:<repl>

    <name>   - name of the cache being defined
    <nsets>  - number of sets in the cache
    <bsize>  - block size of the cache
    <assoc>  - associativity of the cache
    <repl>   - block replacement strategy, 'l'-LRU, 'f'-FIFO, 'r'-random

    Examples:   -cache:dl1 dl1:4096:32:1:l
                -dtlb dtlb:128:4096:32:r

  Cache levels can be unified by pointing a level of the instruction cache
  hierarchy at the data cache hiearchy using the "dl1" and "dl2" cache
  configuration arguments.  Most sensible combinations are supported, e.g.,

    A unified l2 cache (il2 is pointed at dl2):
      -cache:il1 il1:128:64:1:l -cache:il2 dl2
      -cache:dl1 dl1:256:32:1:l -cache:dl2 ul2:1024:64:2:l

    Or, a fully unified cache hierarchy (il1 pointed at dl1):
      -cache:il1 dl1
      -cache:dl1 ul1:256:32:1:l -cache:dl2 ul2:1024:64:2:l

VPR FPGA Placement and Routing Program Version 4.00-spec
Source completed August 19, 1997.


General Options:
	Routing will be performed on an existing placement.

Routing Options:
	Combined GLOBAL + DETAILED routing will be performed.
	The router will try at most 30 iterations.
	Routings can go at most 3 channels outside their bounding box.
	Cost of a bend (bend_cost) is 0.
	First iteration sharing penalty factor (first_iter_pres_fac): 4
	Initial (2nd iter.) sharing penalty factor (initial_pres_fac): 8
	Sharing penalty growth factor (pres_fac_mult): 2
	Accumulated sharing penalty factor (acc_fac): 1
	Router will attempt routing only with a channel width factor of 15.
